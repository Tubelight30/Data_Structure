# Linked List Example

> Refer to linked_list2.cpp
>the program is pretty self explanatory with appropriate comments.
>This is a simple example of how to create and print a linked list in C++.

## Overview

> - A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are useful for storing and manipulating data that needs to be dynamically allocated or resized.  

> - In this example, we define a class called "Node" that represents a node in a linked list. Each node contains an integer value and a pointer to the next node in the list. We also define a function called "print" that takes a pointer to the head of a linked list and prints out the values of each node in the list.

> - Overall, this code provides a simple example of how to create and print a linked list in C++. It demonstrates the basic concepts of linked lists, including node creation, linking nodes together, and traversing the list to access node data

## Usage

To use this example, simply compile and run the code using a C++ compiler. The program will create a linked list with five nodes containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and then print out the values of each node using the "print" function.
