# Stack

Work on the concept of LIFO(Last In First Out). The element which is inserted last will be deleted first. It is like a stack of plates. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed. The plate which is at the bottom is the last one to be removed.
>For inserting: push function
>For deleting: pop function
>For Top: peek function or top function
>For checking if empty: isEmpty function
>For checking Size: size function

we will use a array or Linked List to implement stack. We create a class and Keep the array or LL private and expose the functions to the user.
